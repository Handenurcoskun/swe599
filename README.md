## Contents

The repository includes the following files:

- `textual_analysis.py`: Python script for performing textual analysis on social media data.
- `visual_analysis.py`: Python script for performing visual and video analysis on social media data.
- `audio_analysis.py`: Python script for performing audio analysis on social media data.
- `data.csv`: Sample dataset used for the analysis.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following packages and libraries installed:

- pandas
- textblob
- scikit-learn
- keras
